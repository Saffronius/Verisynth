Let me analyze the given strings to create a regex pattern that matches them.

All of the strings start with "arn:aws:ec2:::/" and then have either nothing after it or a single character after it.

Looking at the examples:
- "arn:aws:ec2:::/" (occurs multiple times in the list)
- "arn:aws:ec2:::/A" through "arn:aws:ec2:::/Z" (uppercase letters)
- "arn:aws:ec2:::/[", "arn:aws:ec2:::/\", "arn:aws:ec2:::/]", etc. (various special characters)
- "arn:aws:ec2:::/f", "arn:aws:ec2:::/h", etc. (some lowercase letters)
- "arn:aws:ec2:::/ " (space)
- "arn:aws:ec2:::/¡" through various Unicode characters
- "arn:aws:ec2:::/\u{100}" through "arn:aws:ec2:::/\u{249}" (Unicode escape sequences)

The pattern I need to create must:
1. Match the fixed prefix "arn:aws:ec2:::/"
2. Optionally match any single character that follows this prefix (including Unicode characters)

The regex for this would be:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/.*
```

But that's overly permissive as it would allow any number of characters after the prefix. I need to be more specific:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(.)?
```

This matches the prefix followed by optionally one character of any kind.

Let me check if this is correct:
- It matches "arn:aws:ec2:::/" (empty after the prefix)
- It matches "arn:aws:ec2:::/A" (single character after the prefix)
- It matches "arn:aws:ec2:::/\u{100}" (a Unicode code point after the prefix)

Actually, I need to be careful with the Unicode escape sequences like "\u{100}". The string representation contains 8 characters after the prefix: \, u, {, 1, 0, 0, }, not a single Unicode character. But the raw data that this represents is a single Unicode character.

Let's double-check some of these examples to be more certain:

"arn:aws:ec2:::/\u{100}" - Is this a string that actually contains the characters '\', 'u', '{', '1', '0', '0', '}', or is it meant to represent the Unicode character U+0100 (Ā)?

Given the context and consistency of the other examples, I believe these are meant to be taken as representing the actual Unicode characters, not the escape sequence literals.

So my regex should be:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(.)?
```

This matches the prefix "arn:aws:ec2:::/" followed by optionally any single character. This should work for all the examples provided.

Wait, let me double check this. Unicode escape sequences like \u{100} might be represented differently in different regex flavors. Since no specific flavor is mentioned, I'll use a standard one:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(.)?
```

This should work for all standard regex engines to match the prefix followed by optionally any single character, but it assumes the Unicode characters are already properly decoded.

Let's check one more time. I'm being asked for a "single regex that accepts each string in the following set of strings." All the strings have the form:

"arn:aws:ec2:::/" followed by either nothing or a single character.

So the regex pattern should be:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(.)?
```

This reads as: Match "arn:aws:ec2:::/" followed by optionally any single character. The "?" after the capturing group "(.)" means "0 or 1 of the preceding element".

I believe this is the correct regex for the given requirements. It's specific enough to match only the given pattern and not overly permissive.

Actually let me look one more time at the input to make sure this is the right regex.

I notice that the strings include escape sequences like "\u{100}". In the raw strings (as they appear in the prompt), these are multi-character sequences representing a single Unicode code point. However, the regex I'm being asked to provide is meant to match the decoded strings where these escape sequences have been converted to the actual Unicode characters.

So for a string like "arn:aws:ec2:::/\u{100}", the regex should match it as if it's "arn:aws:ec2:::/Ā" (where Ā is the actual Unicode character U+0100).

Given this understanding, the regex I provided earlier is correct:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(.)?
```

This matches the prefix "arn:aws:ec2:::/" followed by optionally any single character, including Unicode characters.

But actually, I'm not sure how the regex engine will interpret "\u{100}" in the input - will it see it as a 6-character sequence or as a single Unicode character? Let me try to be more explicit:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(?:[\s\S])?
```

Here, `[\s\S]` matches any character (including newlines), and the `?` makes it optional. This is another way to write "any character, optional".

But in standard regex, "." already matches any character except newline. Since we're not expecting newlines in this context, I think the original regex is still correct:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(.)?
```

Or, without the unnecessary capturing group:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/[.\s]?
```

Actually, ".?" could match a literal "." character (in character class, "." does not need to be escaped), which isn't what I meant at a minimum. It's better to be more explicit.

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(?:[\s\S])?
```

Here, `[\s\S]` means "any whitespace or non-whitespace character", which is a way to say "any character including newlines". The `?` makes it optional.

On a second thought, I'm overthinking this. Given the context, the simplest and most accurate regex would be:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/.?
```

This matches the prefix "arn:aws:ec2:::/" followed by optionally any character.

Hmm, actually, the "." might get interpreted as a literal period in some contexts. Let me make sure:

The standard way to interpret "." in a regex is "any character except a newline", but outside a character class, "." means "match any character except newline", not a literal period. So ".?" does mean "optionally match any character except a newline".

Given the specificity of the request, I'll use the most explicit form:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(?:.)?
```

This reads as: Match "arn:aws:ec2:::/" followed by optionally any character (except a newline).

Since we're not expecting newlines, and to keep it as simple as possible, I'm going back to my original answer:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/.?
```

This should be the right regex for the given requirements. It's specific enough to match only the given pattern and not overly permissive.

But actually let me just double check this. In particular, the examples include things like "arn:aws:ec2:::/\", which has a backslash, which needs to be escaped in regex.

On second thought, since the examples include characters like backslash, which need to be escaped in regex, I'll use a slightly different form to be extra safe:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(?:[\s\S])?
```

Here, `[\s\S]` is a character class that matches any character (including newlines), and the `?` makes it optional. This is a more explicit way to write "any character, optional", and it avoids potential issues with special characters.

However, this might still be overkill. In most regex flavors, the simpler form is still correct:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/.?
```

This should match the prefix "arn:aws:ec2:::/" followed by optionally any character (except a newline, in most implementations).

I think this is the correct regex for the given requirements. It's specific enough to match only the given pattern and not overly permissive.

Let me try to be perfectly clear one last time. The regex should match:

1. The literal string "arn:aws:ec2:::/"
2. Optionally, any single character after that

This can be expressed as:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/.?
```

Or, with a non-capturing group to be explicit about what the optional part is:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/(?:.)?
```

Both of these are equivalent and should work for the given requirements. The "." matches any character (except a newline in some implementations), and the "?" makes it optional.

So, my final answer is:

```
arn:aws:ec2:::/.?
```

This should accurately match all the strings in the given set without being overly permissive.

I think we're good to go with:

arn:aws:ec2:::/.?
